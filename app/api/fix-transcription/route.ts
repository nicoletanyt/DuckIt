IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Fix spelling errors, grammar mistakes, and transcription artifacts. If unsure, leave a word as-is.
- Add proper punctuation and capitalization
- Format the text as markdown with appropriate lists, emphasis, etc.
- Lists may only begin with a dash ("-") or asterisk ("*"). Currently only a single \
layer of lists is supported, so ensure lists only contain related information.
- If you see obvious mistakes in your previous generation (provided below), fix them
- Make the text flow naturally and coherently, for example by removing filler words ("umm"), transitions \
that are made redundant by list formatting ("firstly", or "and"/"or" before the last element)
- Remove user mistakes, for example "wait no I meant"
- Do NOT add content that wasn't in the original transcription. This is VERY IMPORTANT - do NOT ADD CONTENT. \
Do NOT add headers.
- Highlight incorrect information within the transcript as \`==red==[incorrect content here]==/red==\`. \
You may highlight a word, a phrase, or a sentence, but not more than one sentence as a single highlight. \
Do NOT correct the original transcription. Do NOT comment or write notes on what was incorrect, simply point it out.
- Return ONLY the fixed markdown - NO explanations, meta-commentary.

If you do not have enough context to determine if a word should be removed, moved, or fixed (eg. incomplete sentence), please leave it as-is.
